# - Moving to the decimal places:
#   - 9.9 has a .9 after the decimal point.
#   - 9.11 has a .11 after the decimal point.

# Since 0.9 is less than 0.11, it follows that 9.9 is less than 9.11.

# Comparing digit by digit:
#     The integer part (9) is the same for both.
#     The first decimal place (9 vs. 1): 9 is larger.
